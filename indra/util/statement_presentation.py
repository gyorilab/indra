"""
This module groups and sorts Statements for presentation in downstream tools
while aggregating the statements' statistics/metrics into the groupings.  While
most usage of this module will be via the top-level function
`group_and_sort_statements`, alternative usages (including custom statement
data, multiple statement grouping levels, and multiple strategies for
aggregating statement-level metrics for higher-level groupings) are supported
through the various classes (see Class Overview below). 

Vocabulary
----------

An "agent-pair" is, as the name suggests, a pair of agents from a statement,
usually defined by their canonical names.

A "relation" is the basic information of a statement, with all details (such as
sites, residues, mutations, and bound conditions) stripped away. Usually this
means it is just the statement type (or verb), subject name, and object name,
though in some corner cases it is different.

Simple Example
--------------

The principal function in the module is `group_and_sort_statements`, and if you
want statements grouped into agent-pairs, then by relations, sorted by evidence
count, simply use the function with its defaults, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

  for _, ag_key, rels, ag_metrics in group_and_sort_statements(stmts):
      print(ag_key)
      for _, rel_key, stmt_data, rel_metrics in rels:
          print('\t', rel_key)
          for _, stmt_hash, stmt_obj, stmt_metrics in stmt_data:
              print('\t\t', stmt_obj)

Advanced Example
----------------

Custom data and aggregation methods are supported, respectively, by using
instances of the `StmtStat` class and subclassing the BasicAggregator (or more
generally, the AggregatorMeta) API. Custom sorting is implemented by defining
and passing a `sort_by` function to `group_and_sort_statements`.

For example, if you have custom statement metrics (e.g., a value obtained by
experiment such as differential expression of subject or object genes), want
the statements grouped only to the level of relations, and want to sort the
statements and relations independently. Suppose also that your measurement
applies equally at the statement and relation level and hence you don't want
any changes applied during aggregation (e.g. averaging). This is illustrated in
the example below:

.. code-block:: python

   # Define a new aggregator that doesn't apply any aggregation function to
   # the data, simply taking the last metric (effectively a noop):
   class NoopAggregator(BasicAggregator):
       def _merge(self, metric_array):
           self.values = metric_array

   # Create your StmtStat using custom data dict `my_data`, a dict of values
   # keyed by statement hash:
   my_stat = StmtStat('my_stat', my_data, int, NoopAggregator)

   # Define a custom sort function using my stat and the default available
   # ev_count. In effect this will sort relations by the custom stat, and then
   # secondarily sort the statements within that relation (for which my_stat
   # is by design the same) using their evidence counts.
   def my_sort(metrics):
       return metrics['my_stat'], metrics['ev_count']

   # Iterate over the results.
   groups = group_and_sort_statements(stmts, sort_by=my_sort,
                                      custom_stats=[my_stat],
                                      grouping_level='relation')
   for _, rel_key, rel_stmts, rel_metrics in groups:
       print(rel_key, rel_metrics['my_stat'])
       for _, stmt_hash, stmt, metrics in rel_stmts:
           print('\t', stmt, metrics['ev_count'])

Class Overview
--------------

Statements can have multiple metrics associated with them, most commonly
belief, evidence counts, and source counts, although other metrics may also be
applied. Such metrics imply an order on the set of Statements, and a user
should be able to apply that order to them for sorting or filtering.  them.
These types of metric, or "stat", are represented by `StmtStat` classes.

Statements can be grouped based on the information they represent: by their
agents (e.g. subject is MEK and object is ERK), and by their type (e.g.
Phosphorylation). These groups are represented by `StmtGroup` objects, which on
their surface behave much like `defaultdict(list)` would, though more is going
on behind the scenes. The StmtGroup class is used internally by
`group_and_sort_statements` and would only need to be used directly if defining
an alternative statement-level grouping approach (e.g., grouping statements by
subject).

Like Statements, higher-level statement groups are subject to sorting and
filtering. That requires that the `StmtStat`s be aggregated over the statements
in a group. The Aggregator classes serve this purpose, using numpy to do sums
over arrays of metrics as Statements are "included" in the `StmtGroup`. Each
`StmtStat` must declare how its data should be aggregated, as different kinds
of data aggregate differently. Custom aggregation methods can be implemented by
subclassing the `BasicAggregator` class and using an instance of the custom
class to define a `StmtStat`.

class StmtGroup:
    """Creates higher-level stmt groupings and aggregates metrics accordingly.

    Used internally by `group_and_sort_statements`.

    This class manages the accumulation of statistics for statement groupings,
    such as by relation or agent pair. It calculates metrics for these
    higher-level groupings using metric-specific aggregators implementing the
    AggregatorMeta API (e.g., MultiAggregator and any children of
    BasicAggregator).

    For example, evidence counts for a relation can be calculated as the sum of
    the statement-level evidence counts, while the belief for the relation can
    be calculated as the average or maximum of the statement-level beliefs.

    The primary methods for instantiating this class are the two factory
    class methods:
    - from_stmt_stats
    - from_dicts
    See the methods for more details on their purpose and usage.

    Once instantiated, the StmtGroup behaves like a defaultdict of lists, where
    the keys are group-level keys, and the lists contain statements.
    Statements can be iteratively added to the group via the dict-like syntax
    `stmt_group[group_key].include(stmt)`. This allows the caller to generate
    keys and trigger metric aggregation in a single iteration over statements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stmt_list : list[Statement]
        A list of INDRA statements.
    sort_by : str or function or None
        If str, it indicates which parameter to sort by, such as 'belief' or
        'ev_count', or 'ag_count'. Those are the default options because they
        can be derived from a list of statements, however if you give a custom
        `stmt_metrics`, you may use any of the parameters used to build it.
        The default, 'default', is mostly a sort by ev_count but also favors
        statements with fewer agents. Alternatively, you may give a function
        that takes a dict as its single argument, a dictionary of metrics. These
        metrics are determined by the contents of the `stmt_metrics` passed
        as an argument (see StmtGroup for details), or else will contain
        the default metrics that can be derived from the statements themselves,
        namely `ev_count`, `belief`, and `ag_count`. The value may also
        be None, in which case the sort function will return the
        same value for all elements, and thus the original order of elements
        will be preserved. This could have strange effects when statements are
        grouped (i.e. when `grouping_level` is not 'statement'); such
        functionality is untested and we make no guarantee that it will work.
    custom_stats : list[StmtStat]
        A list of custom statement statistics to be used in addition to, or upon
        name conflict in place of, the default statement statistics derived from
        the list of statements.
    grouping_level : str
        The options are 'agent-pair', 'relation', and 'statement'. These
        correspond to grouping by agent pairs, agent and type relationships, and
        a flat list of statements. The default is 'agent-pair'.

    Returns
    -------
    sorted_groups : list[tuple]
        A list of tuples of the form (sort_param, key, contents, metrics), where
        the sort param is whatever value was calculated to sort the results,
        the key is the unique key for the agent pair, relation, or statements,
        and the contents are either relations, statements, or statement JSON,
        depending on the level. This structure is recursive, so the each list
        of relations will also follow this structure, all the way down to
        the lowest level (statement JSON). The metrics a dict of the aggregated
        metrics for the entry (e.g. source counts, evidence counts, etc).
